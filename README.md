##  What is EventFlow?

**EventFlow** is an open-source, modular web platform that provides complete digital infrastructure to run hackathons, open-source programs, and community tech events.

It replaces scattered tools like **Google Forms, Sheets, emails, and chats** with **one unified system**.

---

## Problem Statement

Most tech events rely on:

- Disconnected tools  
- Manual tracking  
- Error-prone spreadsheets  
- No reusable infrastructure  

This causes confusion, unfair judging, and poor participant experience.

**EventFlow solves this with a reusable, modular event engine.**
